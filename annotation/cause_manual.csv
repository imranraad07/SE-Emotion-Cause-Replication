About your comment regarding the tsconfig file locations, my current solution uses the existing `.eslintrc.json` file so I'd imagine the tconfigs are relative to that one and don't cause issues, and it does lint the files inside the ts files inside the `firebase-test-utils` directory, I tested that by violating some rules there and getting indeed errors

I will add an `.eslintrc.json` file there too then :slightly_smiling_face: , I think a good solution would just be to extend the existing `.eslintrc.json` (meaning `""extends"": ""../../.eslintrc.json""`), as that is also what the existing `tsconfig.json` does (

In fact, there is quite an overhead for authors (whomever that might be: the docs team, SWEs and most importantly community contributors). FWIW, our early choice to move the TypeScript and HTML code-snippets outside the Markdown was only made because we believe the benefits of being able to validate the code outweigh the cost of not having the code side-by-side with the rest of the docs content (where it would be much easier to keep in-sync).
So, I strongly believe that there are certain code types (i.e. those we cannot validate) that would be better off being left in the Markdown.
But, since this is related to docs authoring, I am happy to leave it up to the docs team :smiley:","I might be missing something, but I don't see the benefit of moving certain types of code-snippets outside the Markdown.

Some things in the code have very descriptive names or comments, but others sometimes don't, as is the case of `assumeTrue`. I'd say if you can't find an explanation by looking at the code, or in the TypeScript wiki, or in [URL] your best bet is to ask someone from the team and we'll be able to help.
@sandersn and [USER] might have more tips about where/who to ask those kinds of question.
About `assumeTrue`'s meaning: to give you an example, I figured this one out by looking at the code in `narrowTypeByEquality` and seeing that `assumeTrue` had its boolean value flipped if the condition we had was an inequality (e.g. `a !== b`).
**tl;dr** in `narrowTypeByEquality(type, operator, value, assumeTrue)`, if `assumeTrue` is true we should assume `value` has type `type`. Otherwise, we should assume `value` does *not* have type `type`.

Unfortunately, that is not going to work in my setup: I am dynamically importing Preact during the runtime, that is `getPreact()` returns Preact's exports. `jsxImportSource` implies automatic import, which is not going to work.

I'd actually expect TypeScript to *not expect* that `h` can only come from the imports, but rather do what ESBuild does ‚Äî use `h` defined within the scope; like in my situation ‚Äî it is defined at the top of the file. Thus I filed it as a bug report, because it's an absolutely valid use case.
