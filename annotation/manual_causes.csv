In fact, there is quite an overhead for authors (whomever that might be: the docs team, SWEs and most importantly community contributors). FWIW, our early choice to move the TypeScript and HTML code-snippets outside the Markdown was only made because we believe the benefits of being able to validate the code outweigh the cost of not having the code side-by-side with the rest of the docs content (where it would be much easier to keep in-sync).
So, I strongly believe that there are certain code types (i.e. those we cannot validate) that would be better off being left in the Markdown.
But, since this is related to docs authoring, I am happy to leave it up to the docs team :smiley:","I might be missing something, but I don't see the benefit of moving certain types of code-snippets outside the Markdown.

713475952,"To be honest, I'm very new to the team and I don't know if there's a methodical way to figure those things out. I don't think there is, sadly. Some things in the code have very descriptive names or comments, but others sometimes don't, as is the case of `assumeTrue`. I'd say if you can't find an explanation by looking at the code, or in the TypeScript wiki, or in [URL] your best bet is to ask someone from the team and we'll be able to help.
@sandersn and [USER] might have more tips about where/who to ask those kinds of question.
About `assumeTrue`'s meaning: to give you an example, I figured this one out by looking at the code in `narrowTypeByEquality` and seeing that `assumeTrue` had its boolean value flipped if the condition we had was an inequality (e.g. `a !== b`).
**tl;dr** in `narrowTypeByEquality(type, operator, value, assumeTrue)`, if `assumeTrue` is true we should assume `value` has type `type`. Otherwise, we should assume `value` does *not* have type `type`.

Unfortunately, that is not going to work in my setup: I am dynamically importing Preact during the runtime, that is `getPreact()` returns Preact's exports. `jsxImportSource` implies automatic import, which is not going to work. I can, of course, use it to silence TypeScript and continue using ESBuild, which will actually use `h` defined in the scope, but then TypeScript starts to complain about ‘unused’ `h` declaration, while also not saying anything if I don't declare the `h` (duh).
I'd actually expect TypeScript to *not expect* that `h` can only come from the imports, but rather do what ESBuild does — use `h` defined within the scope; like in my situation — it is defined at the top of the file. Thus I filed it as a bug report, because it's an absolutely valid use case.

The only alternative would be treating properties that are known to be getters the same as function calls, which is not what you want in most cases, they are almost always supposed to be treated like regular properties.

So yes the only way you could detect it without troubling people when it mostly isn't necessary is by analyzing the flow in depth, which isn't worth it for such an edge case in my opinion but the issue above has more discussion on that.

* Angular and RxJS go hand in hand from the beginning. In fact I came to know RxJS thanks to Angular. I don't think this was a bad decision. It was a nice standard way for Angular to be reactive. For me the places where it was not used, like `@Input` or lifecycle hooks, feel out of tone from the rest of Angular.
* How do you plan to remove or replace Angular's dependency on RxJS without introducing a massive backward incompatibility breakup like in the AngularJS -> Angular 2+ era? Don't repeat history but learn from it!
* If you manage to not create backward incompatibility issues, then why do you think that introducing input as observable will?
* It _already_ is possible to merely see the usage of observable/observer as a Subscribable pattern. RxJS was meant to be functionality around this pattern. But because Observable was not an ECMA standard like Promise, Observable was included in RxJS. If I remember correctly, Ben Lesh regrets his decision not to make Observable a separate lib apart from RxJS, because now the two are seen as one while in fact they are not.

There are many different ways to solve this issue. Which way is a good one highly depends on the existing code base and the stance of the team regarding this, and my knowledge about the code base is very little.
- Make the `name` property of the existing interface optional.
- Add a new interface with the `name` property optional for this case.
- Use a null-object if an empty name is valid (might cause issues at different locations when a non-empty string is expected).
- Do the workaround just as you did.","There's really no need to get so defensive, this wasn't meant as an attack or anything like that. I saw a discrepancy"

1. The command line parser and typings installer each call the module name resolver in an ad-hoc way under certain circumstances, but they pass a hard-coded `compilerOptions` that lack `paths`, so this code path is never taken.
2. `Project` calls `getAutomaticTypeDirectives` with a `DirectoryStructureHost`, but that function never uses `host.getCurrentDirectory()`.
Changing `ModuleResolutionHost['getCurrentDirectory']` to be non-optional makes these call sites a bit of a nuisance.",.assertion should hold in all cases we currently have
