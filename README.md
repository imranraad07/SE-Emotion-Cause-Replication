  - __/annotation__: A folder that contains annotation instructions and the annotated file.
 - __/blue_score__: A folder that contains the scripts for BLEU score computation for emotion-cause extraction.
 - __/cluster__: A folder that contains the scripts for generating clusters for the case study.
 - __/Emotion_Classification__: A folder that contains scripts for training and testing emotion classification using BERT and RoBERTa.
      - emotion_classification.py: the script of emotion classification.
      - ReadMe.md: contains the readMe on how to run emotion_classification.py.
