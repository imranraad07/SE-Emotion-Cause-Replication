Anyway, the more I look into it, the harder it is for me to find a better wording...I think that the use of the future tense and the ""and"" made me wrongly believe that somehow the second part of the sentence was a consequence of the first one.
Maybe because it just happen that the browser doesn't wait for these operations, the use of the present tense would be more appropriate : _The HeroService must wait for the server to respond, getHeroes() cannot return immediately with hero data, and the browser does not block while the service waits._
If this proposition is not convincing, I think I will consider closing this PR: I would not want to overcomplicate the sentence because I alone mis-interpreted it.

In fact, there is quite an overhead for authors (whomever that might be: the docs team, SWEs and most importantly community contributors). FWIW, our early choice to move the TypeScript and HTML code-snippets outside the Markdown was only made because we believe the benefits of being able to validate the code outweigh the cost of not having the code side-by-side with the rest of the docs content (where it would be much easier to keep in-sync).
So, I strongly believe that there are certain code types (i.e. those we cannot validate) that would be better off being left in the Markdown.

About `assumeTrue`'s meaning: to give you an example, I figured this one out by looking at the code in `narrowTypeByEquality` and seeing that `assumeTrue` had its boolean value flipped if the condition we had was an inequality (e.g. `a !== b`).
**tl;dr** in `narrowTypeByEquality(type, operator, value, assumeTrue)`, if `assumeTrue` is true we should assume `value` has type `type`. Otherwise, we should assume `value` does *not* have type `type`.

There are many different ways to solve this issue. Which way is a good one highly depends on the existing code base and the stance of the team regarding this, and my knowledge about the code base is very little.
- Make the `name` property of the existing interface optional.
- Add a new interface with the `name` property optional for this case.
- Use a null-object if an empty name is valid (might cause issues at different locations when a non-empty string is expected).
- Do the workaround just as you did.","There's really no need to get so defensive, this wasn't meant as an attack or anything like that.

* Angular and RxJS go hand in hand from the beginning. In fact I came to know RxJS thanks to Angular. I don't think this was a bad decision. It was a nice standard way for Angular to be reactive. For me the places where it was not used, like `@Input` or lifecycle hooks, feel out of tone from the rest of Angular.
* How do you plan to remove or replace Angular's dependency on RxJS without introducing a massive backward incompatibility breakup like in the AngularJS -> Angular 2+ era? Don't repeat history but learn from it!
* If you manage to not create backward incompatibility issues, then why do you think that introducing input as observable will?
* It _already_ is possible to merely see the usage of observable/observer as a Subscribable pattern. RxJS was meant to be functionality around this pattern. But because Observable was not an ECMA standard like Promise, Observable was included in RxJS. If I remember correctly, Ben Lesh regrets his decision not to make Observable a separate lib apart from RxJS, because now the two are seen as one while in fact they are not.

Unfortunately, that is not going to work in my setup: I am dynamically importing Preact during the runtime, that is `getPreact()` returns Preact's exports. `jsxImportSource` implies automatic import, which is not going to work. I can, of course, use it to silence TypeScript and continue using ESBuild, which will actually use `h` defined in the scope, but then TypeScript starts to complain about ‘unused’ `h` declaration, while also not saying anything if I don't declare the `h` (duh).
I'd actually expect TypeScript to *not expect* that `h` can only come from the imports, but rather do what ESBuild does — use `h` defined within the scope; like in my situation — it is defined at the top of the file. Thus I filed it as a bug report, because it's an absolutely valid use case.

With the regexes done beforehand we will parse each file one extra time, which thinking of that, it's not even that bad as this is just done at build time so it's not like it needs to be ultra performant or anything (also regexes are should be quite optimized right?)

There is not much typescript can do about this without breaking it's [Non-Goal No 3]([URL]
[BLOCK QUOTE].
The only alternative would be treating properties that are known to be getters the same as function calls, which is not what you want in most cases, they are almost always supposed to be treated like regular properties. This kind of check is quite common check to prevent check if a value is not null so flagging it based on the signature alone would be annoying to most people that dont have such edge case uses as they'd have to do the non-null assertion even if it's not really needed.
So yes the only way you could detect it without troubling people when it mostly isn't necessary is by analyzing the flow in depth, which isn't worth it for such an edge case in my opinion but the issue above has more discussion on that.
On top of that a simple way to avoid this using modern ECMAScript features is `a.member?.do()`.",".this shouldn't really be, which isn't worth it",While I do agree with [USER],"which is not what you want in most cases, they are almost always supposed to be treated like regular properties.",The cause of the frustration is that the code is not being able to detect the bug without analyzing the flow in depth.,445,,,Disapproval,Aggravation,Agreement,Frustration
944607416,"Unfortunately there's disadvantages to this approach too -- Android/iOS tools no longer work because files appear to be missing, for example. Understanding what Android/iOS want from you is harder because the files aren't there so you can't just explore the files and find the comments we left explaining things. You could imagine a mode where you ask the files to appear, then edit them, then ask the unchanged files to be removed, but now there's extra steps, none of which are obvious to the developer, and it's easy to accidentally add or delete the wrong file (or make trivial changes that you don't need to save), etc.
I do wish something like this would exist, though.
