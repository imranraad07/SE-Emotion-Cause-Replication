"For my larger suppliers, I will often have a 100 or more requirements built up.",0
"Since the ""Approved Requirements"" screen paginates the requirements, I'll end up generating multiple orders for the same (large) supplier, simply because the application operates a page at a time.",0
This annoys my suppliers a bit.,0
"I guess the obvious thing to do is to go in and reconfigure the pagination so it doesn't (paginate), but if we had the ability to add items to existing POs then you could still use the pagination mechanism and build up the PO page-by-page (quite handy if your working through  your POs during less busy times of the day).

This should have been fixed by commit 26a5b76ee6b77909a7b8d5b00924f12e1671373d.,0
"Verified on my vmware setup, extract volume is working fine now.",0
"I did that first, but then remembered that when I did that in the past, people were unable to apply my patches, w/o doing the svn move themselves.",0

"In any case, the code for the toBytes method is written now, so it should be a simple thing to move it to the PType implementation classes.",0

Thank you for working with these components.",0

Do you think you could submit a new patch in a single file (perhaps named with the current date) based on the current SVN head ?,0
That would really help a lot.,0

Do the same tests work fine on 1.5.0dev?,0
"One of the things I changed in jnr-posix, was to make stat and fstat use stati64 and fstati64 respectively, instead of stat64 and fstat - the last may be why its breaking with jna-posix.",0
"Look in WindowsLibCFunctionMapper.java for the fstat mapping - it may all magically work if you change fstat to map to _fstat64 (note: no 'i' in the name - uses stat64 struct instead of stati64 ... they have different sized atime, ctime, mtime fields).",0
"Otherwise, the WindowsFileStat structure looks ok, apart from the st_blocks and st_blksize fields at the end, which are not part of the windows stat64 struct, so will probably be filled with either zero, or garbage.

Oversight?,0
"{quote}
Yes, was an oversight.",0
"Just for clarification, skipBloomFilters is old.",0
#1 and #2 are incorrect.,0
1: The skipBloomFilters gets called on the index file in RowIndexEntry line 104.,0
"2: In 2.0, the skipBloomFilters will be called on a 1.2 sstable; also, the skipBloomFilters currently is called against any sstable when scrubbing.",0

"- I was not sure about the convention of function parameter order, i.e., F(a,b,conf) or F(conf, a,b), but I just followed DictionaryVectorizer.createTermFrequencyVectors that places Configuration parameter after Paths.",0
