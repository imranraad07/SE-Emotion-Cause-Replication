"If regionnames were made of tablename+endrow instead of tablename+startrow, then in the metatables, doing a search for the region that contains the wanted row, we'd just have to open a scanner using passed row and the first row found by the scan would be that of the region we need (If offlined parent, we'd have to scan to the next row).",0
"If so, I'll go ahead and commit this patch.",0
"If tablet unloads were to use the normal compaction queue, may want to prioritize unload related compactions on the queue.",0
"If we had this in place, I think it would help with the migration to this new way of doing the meta because as is, the region name in fs is a hash of regionname... changing the format of the regionname would mean we generate a different hash... so we'd need hbase-2531 to be in place before we could do this change.",0
"If we redid the meta tables in this format, we'd be using an access that is natural to hbase, a scan as opposed to the perverse, expensive getClosestRowBefore we currently have that has to walk backward in meta finding a containing region.",0
"if we want to create a jspwiki-api.jar, we only need to jar up the contents of a particular subdirectory.",0
"If we were using scans, prewarming client cache would be near costless (as opposed to what we'll currently have to do which is first a getClosestRowBefore and then a scan from the closestrowbefore forward).",0

We have so many people contributing in the code that API incompatibilities can creep in without anyone noticing.,0
